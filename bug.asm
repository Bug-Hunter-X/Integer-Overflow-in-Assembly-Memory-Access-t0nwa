mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx * 4`.  The bug arises if `ecx` is a very large value, causing an integer overflow. This could lead to accessing memory outside of the allocated space, resulting in a segmentation fault or unpredictable behavior.  The overflow can happen even if `ebx` and `ecx` are seemingly small if their product exceeds the maximum value for the register size (typically 32-bits).
